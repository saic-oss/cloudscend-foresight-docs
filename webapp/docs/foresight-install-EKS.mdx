## Optionally Install Windows Report Service

If you will be processing any .NET code, you must install Windows Report Service. Follow the steps below to perform the installation.

1. Install Windows Report Service (optional)
   1. Install the app and dependencies (only required if not using the Report Service AMI from AWS Marketplace)
      1. Copy the Windows Report Service App zip file to a Windows Server 2019 machine.
      2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a temp folder.
      3. Download the [install-prereqs.ps1](/installation-scripts/install-prereqs.ps1) and [configure-startup.ps1](/installation-scripts/configure-startup.ps1) powershell scripts to the same temp folder.
      4. Start an Administrator elevated Command Prompt.
      5. Change (cd) to the location of the zip file's extracted temp folder.
      6. Run `powershell -File .\install-prereqs.ps1`
         1. Content will be installed for .Net Framework 4.8, SonarScanner for MSBuild .NET, Visual Studio 2019 Build Tools, and Java 11 JDK.
         2. The files will be downloaded and saved to C:\AMaaS\temp.
         3. After the .Net Framework 4.8 install, the computer may reboot.
            If it does, run `powershell -File .\install-prereqs.ps1` again to make sure the installation has completed.
   2. Run `powershell -File .\configure-startup.ps1` and provide the requested information.
      This step creates a start-report-service.bat file in C:\AMaaS with the provided values.
   3. To start the Windows Report Service, run `C:\AMaaS\start-report-service.bat`.
      Note: make sure port 8080 is exposed and addressable for the "normal" Java Report Service to access.
