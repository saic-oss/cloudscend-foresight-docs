## Security Considerations

**NEED INPUT FROM TEAM _Specific SSP support for your organizations security requirements?_**

We have spent considerable time and effort to ensure your data and source code are well protected. Your information is passed through HTTPS secure encryption. We have evaluated Sage against the NIST Special Publication 800-171 for protecting controlled unclassified data and the NIST Special Publication 800-53 regarding vulnerabilities. And as of the build's production release date, we have addressed any critical and severe vulnerabilities on our containers as provided by MITREâ€™s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list.

## First Time Login

All first time users of Sage will need to create and setup an account.
