## First Time Login

All first time users of Sage will need to create and setup an account. Note, it is possible that your Sage administrator will create an account for you and provide you with the username and temporary password. If that is the case for you, you can login to Sage and skip down to [password management](#security-and-password-management) as you will be required to create a new password on your first login. For everyone else, follow these simple steps to setup your Sage account.

### Create Account

First you will need to register for your account and create a password in the Sage KeyCloak instance.
