# Standard Operation Guidelines

## User Management

When you install the CloudScend Foresight product, an instance of Keycloak will be installed. Keycloak is an identity and security management solution that you will securely store all your CloudScend Foresight user information.

### Roles and Access

The **Sage_User** role is for all users. This role can perform all CloudScend Foresight functionality including the following:

- Onboard applications
- Upload Source Code
- Upload application artifacts
- Run migration estimates
- View reports and dashboards for analysis

### Security and Password Management

Whether you are creating your own account or setting a new password, you must select a password for CloudScend Foresight that meets the following criteria:

- Must have a minimum length of 8 characters
- Must contain at least one upper case character
- Must contain at least one lower case character
- Must contain at least one numeric character
- Must be changed every 180 days
- Must not be the same password as the previous 24 passwords

### Add a New User Account

All first time users of CloudScend Foresight will need to create and setup an account.

Users will need to register for your account and create a password in the CloudScend Foresight Keycloak instance.

**1. Open a web browser and go the the CloudScend Foresight site. _Not sure about this step - how do they get to the CloudScend Foresight site_**

**2. Click on the Register link to create your account.**

**3. Enter your name, email, username and desired password, making sure to confirm your password by entering it a second time to register for a CloudScend Foresight account. Note: All passwords must follow the [password guidelines](#security-and-password-management) above.**

**4. Click Register to create your user account.**

**5. Once you have created your account, you are ready to login and begin [managing applications](foresight-managing-apps.mdx).**

:::important
Keycloak administration does not do the same field validation that the new user screens perform. If you decide to try to add users from the admin console, it is critical that you enter all required user data. The required user data is user first name, user last name, user email, user password.

## System Tuning

### Packaging Source Code

The CloudScend Foresight product requires uploading the source code of the application to be analyzed in order to provide you with the data regarding the health and cloud readiness of your application. The code should be packaged as a zip file for uploading. The source code folder should be assembled using the following guidelines to ensure optimal analysis.

#### Source Code Supported Languages

CloudScend Foresight provides support for most common programming languages. Below is a list of the current languages that are either fully or partially supported by the CloudScend Foresight product.

#### General Guidelines for Packaging Source Code

1. Only include code that is directly developed for the application and under direct control of the application owner.
2. Keep the directory structure organization as used in your build environment.
3. You can include DDL and SQL files under a folder separate from the source code however this is not necessary for a good scan and can cause very large .zip files.
4. Do not include third party library source code.
5. Do not include past versions of code that have been archived under your repository.
6. Exclude files with the following extensions:
   - \*.javac
   - \*.pdf
   - \*.jdb
   - \*.doc
   - \*.docx
   - \*.psd
   - \*.zip
   - \*.gz
   - \*.bak
7. When creating zip file from source code from an existing Git repository, if the repository contains LFS files, do not use the “Download source code” option from the browser. LFS files will not be included in this zip file and, therefore, will not be uploaded. Instead, clone the Git repository and create a zip file from the local download.
8. The CloudScend Foresight product can support .zip files as large as 2GB. If after preparing your source code per these instructions, your .zip file is larger than 2GB please contact the SAIC Help Desk for assistance processing the larger file.

#### Specific Guidelines for Java Applications

1. Keep all build artifacts as used by your dependency management and build automation tool (e.g. maven, gradle or ant)
2. If application is a web application, keep all static content like HTML CSS, Javascript that is served by the application.

#### Specific Guidelines for .NET Applications

1. Only .Net Framework 4.6 to 4.8 are currently supported.
2. Web Application projects are supported. Legacy Web Site projects are not.
3. Projects targeting multiple frameworks and using preprocessor directives could have slightly inaccurate metrics (lines of code, complexity, etc.) because the metrics are calculated only from the first of the built targets.
4. Zip file for source code upload must contain a \*.sln (Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File) in root directory which then links to the projects to be scanned.
   - If there are multiple \*.sln files, create a separate zip file and onboard as a separate application in CloudScend Foresight.
5. Make sure to include the source code includes all .csproj files with links to the files to be scanned.
6. Make sure to include packages/assemblies/DLLs which your solution uses to compiles.
   - Check with any 3rd party vendor's license requirements.
7. Remove any .gitignore files if present in your source code; the typical .gitignore file will remove packages/assemblies/DLLs which your solution compiles against when ingested into CloudScend Foresight.
8. Source code should have all required configuration so that it can be build locally using MSBuild 14.0 or higher for optimal analysis.

:::note

CloudScend Foresight requires your source code to be compressed into a zip file before uploading. However, it is possible for you to configure your CI pipeline to create an appropriate zip file of your source code and then call our source code uploader API to automatically upload your source code into CloudScend Foresight.

### Storage configuration

**This is a Placeholder for info based on an email the email said:** For Kubernetes deployments, we are using Kubernetes volumes. For plain Docker we are using volumes mapped to local storage, but the customer may be able to configure them as needed.

This is a minimalist approach, and customer will be in charge of backing up the volumes and data. This also removes the licensing issues we have seen. On the other hand if we need something more robust, I can continue looking for an alternative to minio, I don’t think we can’t get around the licensing limitations.

## Backup and Restore

### Keycloak Backup & Restore

Before making any significant environment changes, you should backup your Keycloak instance in order to keep your registered user information intact. Follow the steps below to backup your Keycloak instance.

**1. Perform a Keycloak export. Use the [Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_export_import) for more information on this.**

**2. Browse to /opt/jboss/keycloak**

**3. Run the following in the Keycloak pod.**

```
bin/standalone.sh -Dkeycloak.migration.action=export -Dkeycloak.migration.provider=singleFile \
-Dkeycloak.migration.usersExportStrategy=SAME_FILE -Dkeycloak.migration.file=keycloak-export.json \
 -Djboss.http.port=8888 -Djboss.https.port=9999 -Djboss.management.http.port=7777
```

**4. Copy files from pod to local system or to the other pod**

```
kubectl cp <some-namespace>/<some-pod>:/tmp/foo /tmp/bar
kubectl cp -n keycloak keycloak/keycloak-0:/opt/jboss/keycloak/sage-keycloak-dev.json ./sage-keycloak-dev.json
```

**5.Edit the JSON as required (More information to come)**

**6. To restore the instance, import the JSON via the UI using the Keycloak Admin User**
