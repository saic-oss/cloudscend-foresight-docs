# Sage Cloud App Modernization

SAIC is transforming how government enterprises can rapidly migrate at a low risk a multitude of applications to the cloud with Sage product. According to a 2020 study by the Congressional Research Service, application complexity is a major roadblock limiting the enterprises from successfully completing migration of applications on time and budget. A deeper analysis is needed to understand inner working of complex applications to help determine cloud readiness and plan out the right migration path, but such analysis takes significant efforts when performed manually. Some enterprises try to substitute the analysis by using subjective, survey-based assessments which yields less than 40% of cloud migrations success from industry study. In short, the enterprises are not able to perform necessary analysis of applications rapidly and accurately to enable a successful migration at a scale that can support a larger portfolio of applications developed in heterogeneous technologies such as Java, C#, PHP, and COBOL.

Sage can be used used to solve some of these issues using cloud migration best practices which are implemented as user-friendly features.
