# Troubleshooting and Support

Occasionally you may receive an error or have a page that doesn't render completely. When this happens, you should follow these steps:

**1. First, simply retry the activity a second time or in the case of a page not rendering, try refreshing the page. You may have moments of communications failures with the database or other Sage containers and this simple refresh may solve your problem.**

**2. If after making a second attempt, you still receive the error, you should try logging out of Sage and then log back in and try again.**

**3. If you are still unsuccessful at performing your desired task, it's time to troubleshoot using the diagnostic procedures in the [Operations Guide](sage-ops-diagnostic.mdx).**

**4. If you are in need of further assistance, contact the SAIC help desk at example@saic.com or 123-456-7890.**
