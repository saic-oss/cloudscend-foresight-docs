# Standard Operation Guidelines

## User Management

When you install the Sage product, an instance of KeyCloak will be installed. KeyCloak is an identity and security management solution that you will use to perform user administration tasks. You will provide the password you want for your KeyCloak admin account at installation time. This admin account is strictly for use with your KeyCloak instance and cannot be used for access to the Sage product itself.

### Roles and Access

The **Sage_User** role is for general users. This role can perform the following:

- Onboard applications
- Upload Source Code
- Upload application artifacts
- Run migration estimates
- View reports and dashboards for analysis

The **Sage_Admin** role is for administrators. This role can:

- Can perform all the tasks of a Sage_User
- Can perform user management tasks

### Security and Password Management

Whether you are creating your own account or setting a new password, you must select a password for Sage that meets the following criteria:

- Must have a minimum length of 8 characters
- Must contain at least one upper case character
- Must contain at least one lower case character
- Must contain at least one numeric character
- Must be changed every 180 days
- Must not be the same password as the previous 24 passwords

### Add a New User Account

As a Sage_Admin, follow the steps below to manually add your individual user accounts into KeyCloak.

**1. Access your KeyCloak Administration application at **some provided url\*\* \*\*

**2. Select the Administration Console link on the main screen.**

![KeyCloak Administration Main](/img/KeyCloakAdminMain.png)

**3. Login to KeyCloak Console with your admin username and password.**

![KeyCloak Admin Console Login](/img/KeyCloakAdminUserPwd.png)

From this console, you will be able to add new users and/or set roles for existing users.
You will see that a KeyCloak Realm named AppMod has been created. This is the realm where you should be adding and/or editing users for Sage.

![KeyCloak Admin Console](/img/KeyCloakConsoleRealmSettings.png)

**4. To add a user, select the Users tab on the menu to the left**

![KeyCloak Admin Console Users](/img/KeyCloakConsoleUsersClick.png)

This will allow you to manage your users

Now you will add the roles for the newly created user.

**12. Select the Role Mappings tab for the user**

![KeyCloak Add User Role Mapping](/img/KeyCloakConsoleAddUserRoleMap.png)

From here you will need to remove the New_User_Pending_Review role and add the appropriate role for this user.

**13. Select the New_User_Pending_Review role in the Assigned Roles Column and then click the Remove Selected button**

![KeyCloak Add User Role Remove](/img/KeyCloakConsoleAddUserRoleRemove.png)

**14. Then select either the Sage_Admin and/or Sage_User role from the Available Roles Column and click Add Selected**

![KeyCloak Add User Role Add](/img/KeyCloakConsoleAddUserRoleAdd.png)

At this point, this user is completely set up with a username, password and appropriate role. Repeat the steps above to add other users.

**15. Remember to notify the user that their account has been created, provide them the temporary password and have them log into the Sage product and create a new password.**

**16. Once you are done making your changes, remember to Sign Out of the KeyCloak Admin Console.**

### Set Up Roles for User Added Accounts

A user may access Sage and register for an account from the login screen. When they do this, they will enter their own username and account information but the role will be assigned as the New_User_Pending_Review role. As the administrator, you will need to periodically log in and assign roles to those accounts that are pending. Follow these steps to set the roles for registered accounts.

**1. Access your KeyCloak Administration application at **some provided url\*\* \*\*

**2. Select the Administration Console link on the main screen.**

![KeyCloak Administration Main](/img/KeyCloakAdminMain.png)

**3. Login to KeyCloak Console with your admin username and password.**

![KeyCloak Admin Console Login](/img/KeyCloakAdminUserPwd.png)

**4. Select the Roles tab on the left of the screen to see a list of all available roles. And click on the New_User_Pending_Review role.**

**5. Now, select the Users In Role tab at the top of the page.**

![Key Cloak Admin Console Roles](/img/KeyCloakUserInRoleClick.png)

This will show you all the users who are currently assigned to the New_User_Pending_Review role. The pending review role has no access to Sage and needs to be removed and the appropriate role added for the user.

**6. Click on the username that you would like to set up with a role.**

![KeyCLoak Admin Console ](/img/KeyCloakUserInRolePending.png)

From here you will need to remove the New_User_Pending_Review role and add the appropriate role for this user.

**7. Select the Role Mappings tab for the user**

![KeyCloak Add User Role Mapping](/img/KeyCloakConsoleAddUserRoleMap.png)

**8. Select the New_User_Pending_Review role in the Assigned Roles Column and then click the Remove Selected button**

**9. Then select either the Sage_Admin and/or Sage_User role from the Available Roles Column and click Add Selected**

![KeyCloak Add User Role Add](/img/KeyCloakConsoleAddUserRoleAdd.png)

At this point, this user is completely set up with the appropriate role. Repeat the steps above for each user currently in the New_User_Pending_Review role.

**10. Remember to notify the user that their role has been set and they can now log into the Sage product.**

**11. Once you are done making your changes, remember to Sign Out of the KeyCloak Admin Console.**

![KeyCloak Admin Console Sign Out](/img/KeyCloakConsoleLogOut.png)

### Editing or Deleting a User

There may be times, for whatever reason, that you want to edit user information or remove a users access to Sage. In those cases, you can simply edit or delete the user information from KeyCloak. Follow the steps below to edit user information or delete a user.

**1. Access your KeyCloak Administration application at **some provided url\*\* \*\*

**2. Select the Administration Console link on the main screen.**

## System Tuning

### Packaging Source Code

The Sage product requires uploading the source code of the application to be analyzed in order to provide you with the data regarding the health and cloud readiness of your application. The code should be packaged as a zip file for uploading. The source code folder should be assembled using the following guidelines to ensure optimal analysis.

#### Source Code Supported Languages

Sages provides support for most common programming languages. Below is a list of the current languages that are either fully or partially supported by the Sage product.

#### General Guidelines for Packaging Source Code

1. Only include code that is directly developed for the application and under direct control of the application owner.
2. Keep the directory structure organization as used in your build environment.
3. You can include DDL and SQL files under a folder separate from the source code however this is not necessary for a good scan and can cause very large .zip files.
4. Do not include third party library source code.
5. Do not include past versions of code that have been archived under your repository.
6. Exclude files with the following extensions:
   - \*.javac
   - \*.pdf
   - \*.jdb
   - \*.doc
   - \*.docx
   - \*.psd
   - \*.zip
   - \*.gz
   - \*.bak
7. When creating zip file from source code from an existing Git repository, if the repository contains LFS files, do not use the “Download source code” option from the browser. LFS files will not be included in this zip file and, therefore, will not be uploaded. Instead, clone the Git repository and create a zip file from the local download.
8. The Sage product can support .zip files as large as 2GB. If after preparing your source code per these instructions, your .zip file is larger than 2GB please contact the Sage Help Desk for assistance processing the larger file.

#### Specific Guidelines for Java Applications

1. Keep all build artifacts as used by your dependency management and build automation tool (e.g. maven, gradle or ant)
2. If application is a web application, keep all static content like HTML CSS, Javascript that is served by the application.

#### Specific Guidelines for .NET Applications

1. Only .Net Framework 4.6 to 4.8 are currently supported.
2. Web Application projects are supported. Legacy Web Site projects are not.
3. Projects targeting multiple frameworks and using preprocessor directives could have slightly inaccurate metrics (lines of code, complexity, etc.) because the metrics are calculated only from the first of the built targets.
4. Zip file for source code upload must contain a \*.sln (Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File) in root directory which then links to the projects to be scanned.
   - If there are multiple \*.sln files, create a separate zip file and onboard as a separate application in Sage.
5. Make sure to include the source code includes all .csproj files with links to the files to be scanned.
6. Make sure to include packages/assemblies/DLLs which your solution uses to compiles.
   - Check with any 3rd party vendor's license requirements.
7. Remove any .gitignore files if present in your source code; the typical .gitignore file will remove packages/assemblies/DLLs which your solution compiles against when ingested into Sage.
8. Source code should have all required configuration so that it can be build locally using MSBuild 14.0 or higher for optimal analysis.

### Storage configuration

**This is a Placeholder for info based on an email the email said:** For Kubernetes deployments, we are using Kubernetes volumes. For plain Docker we are using volumes mapped to local storage, but the customer may be able to configure them as needed.

This is a minimalist approach, and customer will be in charge of backing up the volumes and data. This also removes the licensing issues we have seen. On the other hand if we need something more robust, I can continue looking for an alternative to minio, I don’t think we can’t get around the licensing limitations.

## Backup and Restore
