# Managing Your Applications

Once you have logged into CloudScend Foresight, you will be presented with the CloudScend Foresight home page. From the CloudScend Foresight home page you can select what actions you would like to perform. You can choose the following:

- Add new applications through [Onboarding](#onboarding) tasks.
- View your application portfolio dashboards from the [App Portfolio](#app-portfolio)
- Upload source code, artifacts, enter surveys and run migration estimates from the [App Analyzer](#app-analyzer)
- Learn more about your application's code health and technical debt over the course of their lifetime through [Continuous Assessment](#continuous-assessment)
- Perform data mining on your own to answer questions about your app portfolio using our [Knowledge Discovery](#knowledge-discovery) option.

<br></br>

### Uploading Source Code

Now that you have entered your information and taken the survey, it's time to upload your application source code. You will want to upload your source code to begin your migration estimate but you may upload your code at any other time as well. You will want to upload your source code throughout your refactoring process to keep track of your progress and keep on top of any new issues that have been created by your refactoring.
For detailed information regarding packaging your source code for uploading, refer to the [CloudScend Foresight Operations Guide](/docs/foresight-ops-standard-guidelines#packaging-source-code).

**1. Select the Upload Source Code icon.**

![Source Upload](/img/SourceUploadIcon.png)

<br></br>

**2. Click on the file selector icon.**

![File uploader](/img/SourceUploader.png)

**3. Use the File Explorer window to navigate to your zipped up source code. Select the .zip file you want to upload and click the Open button.**

![File Explorer Selection](/img/FileSelector.png)

<br></br>

**4. Click the Upload button to complete the upload of your source code.**

![Source Upload](/img/ClickUpload.png)

You will see that as soon as your source code is uploaded, the CloudScend Foresight analyzer begins working and your App Analysis Status is now Processing.

![Source Code Processing](/img/SourceCodeProcessing.png)

And when the initial analysis is complete, your App Analysis Status will change to Analysis Results Ready.

![Analysis Results Ready](/img/AnalysisResultsReady.png)

### Migration Metrics Reports Details

The CloudScend Foresight product will provide you with 4 reports once your source code is processed. Each of these reports provide different information regarding your application based on the source code you uploaded.

#### Application Assessment Report Details

The Application Assessment Report provides you with general overview of your source code with information about the size and type of your source code as provided by a SonarQube scan. You will be presented with data regarding the following:

1. All languages supported in your source code
2. The overall number of executable lines of code (LOC)
3. The total number of physical lines of code
4. The total number of commented lines of code
5. By file, the number of executable lines of code and the number of complex lines of the code where it can be determined.

#### Application Technical Debt Report Details

The Application Technical Debt Report provides you with an overall SAIC technical debt score as well as specific details regarding issues within your source code as provided by a SonarQube scan. You will be presented with the following information:

1. A calculated total technical debt as well as the technical debt broken down by maintainability issues, reliability issues and security issues
2. A calculated technical debt rating from 1.0 - 5.0 where 1.0 means very low technical debt and 5.0 means very high technical debt
3. A detailed breakdown by issue type (maintainability, reliability, security) including the following
   - File name
   - Suggested code change
   - Line number
   - Severity (Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor)

#### Application Cloud Readiness Report Details

The Application Cloud Readiness report is generated by the CAST Highlight tool and presents you with metrics and analysis. Each of these metrics convey specific measurable dimension of code quality and cloud readiness.

1. Normalized Cloud Readiness Index - Higher scores indicate an application is better suited for cloud migration with fewer modifications.
2. The number of security vulnerabilities
3. Cloud Blocker Score - Lower scores indicate fewer blockers to cloud migration
4. Software Resiliency index represents the presence of good or bad programming habits within your source code that make it more or less robust and secure. The higher the index the lower the likehood of defects in production.
5. Software Agility index represents the ease of maintaining your application source code. The higher the index the easier the code is to understand and maintain.
6. Software Elegance index represents code complexity. The higher the index the fewer potential defects that may arise from your code.
7. Obsolescence information informs you of the number of frameworks that are obsolete and need remediation.
8. CAST Technical Debt refers to the cost to fix the structural quality of the application per CAST Highlight calculations. Note, that this value will differ from the Technical Debt report above as CAST Highlight and SonarQube calculate technical debt differently.

#### Application Cost Estimate Report Details

The Application Cost Estimate report utilizes data from the Cloud Readiness Report as well as your business impact survey answers and feeds it into both a tailored COCOMO Model and a proprietary machine learning model to provide the following pieces of information.

1. The Percent Design Modified value is a percentage of the application design that must be modified to adapt to the new objectives or environment.
2. The Percent Code Modified value is a percentage of the application code that must be modified to adapt to the new objectives or environment.
3. The Software Understand value is a penalty based on the ease of understanding the code, with lower values representing better structured and descriptive code.
4. The Required Software Reliability refers to the effect caused if there is a software failure.
5. The Product Complexity value refers to specific areas of operations for your software that may effect the effort to migrate your application.
6. The Estimated Effort is the amount of time estimated to be required for completion in units of Person-Months

:::note
It is of interest to know that because CloudScend Foresight is integrated with multiple best in class applications, there are a few pieces of data that each of our partnering applications calculate differently. For example, both CAST Highlight and SonarQube provide technical debt information but they have their own proprietary formula for calculating it. Therefore, in some locations you may see differing values for technical debt depending on the report that is being viewed.
:::

We have provided read only access to the database tables below so you can create charts, graphs and perform analysis with the CloudScend Foresight data. The read only account information was provided with your CloudScend Foresight licenses. You can use the [CloudScend Foresight Data Dictionary](foresight-data-dictionary.mdx) to determine what data is available to you. Below are the basic steps you can take to create your own analytics using Metabase.

**1. From the Metabase admin menu, add a database.**

![Add Database](/img/MetabaseAddDatabase.png)

**2. Create a dashboard and name it.**

![Create Dashboard](/img/MetabaseAddDashBoard.png)

![New Dashboard](/img/MetabaseNewDashboard.png)

This will give you an empty dashboard.

![Empty Board](/img/MetabaseEmptyDashboard.png)

**3. Now it's time to get your question answered and added to your dashboard. Select "Ask a question".**

![Ask](/img/MetabaseAskQuestion.png)

**4. Select the type of question you want to ask. In this case we will select complex..**

![Custom](/img/MetabaseCustomQuestion.png)

**5. Select all the tables, columns, filters, and sort options you would like as part of your question. In this example we are asking question 1 above.**

![Question](/img/MetabaseSelectData.png)

**6. Select Visualize at the bottom of the screen and you will be presented with the data for your question.**

![Data](/img/MetabaseAnswerData.png)

**7. Select Visualization at the bottom of this screen. You will now be able to select the type of visualization you would like to see. In this case we will select Scatter and set the Scatter options.**

![Scatter](/img/MetabaseScatterBasic.png)

You can see that if you hover over the bubble in the top left of the screen, that App0031 has the highest cloud readiness index and the lowest technical debt rating, making it an easy win for moving to the cloud.

**8. If you are happy with your display you can select Done in the Settings panel and then select Save to save your question.**

![Save](/img/MetabaseQuestionSave.png)

You can, of course, try differing ways to display your data or enter varying constraints and options on the data you would like to view.

**9. Once you save your question you can choose to add it to a dashboard or simply save it for later.**

:::note

You can also create questions using Native Queries if you are knowledgeable in SQL. For example, if you wanted to answer question 7 above, you would enter the following native SQL statement into the Metabase new question (Native Query) window and then select how you want to view your data.

```
SELECT
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_cast_app_name as "Application Name",
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_cast_highlight_cloud_blocker_index as "Blocker"
FROM
    app_org INNER JOIN app_cast_highlight_tech_properties ON app_org.app_global_id = app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_global_id
where
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.end_date isnull

GROUP BY
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_global_id,
    "Application Name",
    "Blocker",

order by
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_cast_highlight_cloud_blocker_index desc;

```
