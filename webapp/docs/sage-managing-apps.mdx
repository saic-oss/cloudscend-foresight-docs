### Migration Metrics Reports Details

The Sage product will provide you with 4 reports once your source code is processed. Each of these reports provide different information regarding your application based on the source code you uploaded.

#### Application Assessment Report Details

The Application Assessment Report provides you with general overview of your source code with information about the size and type of your source code. You will be presented with data regarding the following:

1. All languages supported in your source code
2. The overall number of executable lines of code (LOC)
3. The total number of physical lines of code
4. The total number of commented lines of code
5. By file, the number of executable lines of code and the number of complex lines of the code where it can be deteremined.

#### Application Technical Debt Report Details

The Application Technical Debt Report provides you with an overall SAIC technical debt score as well as specific details regarding issues within your source code. You will be presented with the following information:

1. A calculated total technical debt as well as the technical debt broken down by maintainability issues, reliability issues and security issues
2. A calculated technical debt rating from 1.0 - 5.0 where 1.0 means very low technical debt and 5.0 means very high technical debt
3. A detailed breakdown by issue type (maintainability, reliability, security) including the following
   - File name
   - Suggested code change
   - Line number
   - Severity (Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor)

#### Application Cloud Readiness Report Details

The Application Cloud Readiness report is generated by the CAST Highlight tool and presents you with metrics and analysis. Each of these metrics convey specific measurable dimension of code quality and cloud readiness.

1. Normalized Cloud Readiness Index - Higher scores indicate an application is better suited for Cloud migration with fewer modifications.
2. The number of security vulnerabilities
3. Cloud Blocker Score - Lower scores indicate fewer blockers to Cloud migration
4. Software Resiliency index represents the presence of good or bad programming habits within your source code that make it more or less robust and secure. The higher the index the lower the likehood of defects in production.
5. Software Agility index represents the ease of maintaining your application source code. The higher the index the easier the code is to understand and maintain.
6. Software Elegance index represents code complexity. The higher the index the fewer potential defects that may arise from your code.
7. Obsolesence information informs you of the number of frameworks that are obsolete and need remediation.
8. CAST Technical Debt refers to the cost to fix the structural quality of the application per CAST Highlight calculations.

#### Application Cost Estimate Report Details

The Application Cost Estimate report utilizes data from the Cloud Readiness Report and feeds it into a tailored COCOMO Model and provides the following pieces of information.

1. The Percent Design Modified value is simply a percentage of the application design that must be modified to adapt to the new objectives or environment.
2. The Percent Code Modified value is simply a percentage of the application code that must be modified to adapt to the new objectives or environment.
3. The Software Understand value is a penalty based on the ease of understanding the code, with lower values representing better structured and descriptive code.
4. The Required Software Reliability refers to the effect caused if there is a software failure.
5. The Product Complexity value refers to specific areas of operations for your software that may effect the effort to migrate your application.
6. The Estimated Effort is the amount of time estimated to be required for completion in units of Person-Months
