<br></br>

Once you have submitted your application for onboarding, you will be offered the option to continue on to complete your survey.
:::note

It is common to complete your survey following onboarding your application. While completing the survey is required to analyze your application, it doesn't have to be done immediately following onboarding so you may choose to postpone this step.

:::

**5. Make your selection to complete the survey by selecting the Start Survey button. Optionally, you can choose the Take Later button to postpone completing the survey and you will be taken back to the home screen. However, please note, that you must complete the survey before any application processing will be performed.**

![Confirm Survey](/img/FollowingOnboardingSubmitConfirm.png)

Once you have selected the Complete Survey button, you will be taken to the Survey Window. Please see the [Survey Management](#survey-management) section of this guide for step by step instructions on filling out your survey.

### Survey Management

In order to provide you with the most accurate cloud readiness analysis, you need to complete a short survey with questions regarding your application and its dependencies and interfaces as well as questions regarding the business impact of your application. Please be sure to provide the most accurate information as possible as incorrect answers can affect your output.

### Migration Metrics Reports Details

The Sage product will provide you with 4 reports once your source code is processed. Each of these reports provide different information regarding your application based on the source code you uploaded.

#### Application Assessment Report Details

The Application Assessment Report provides you with general overview of your source code with information about the size and type of your source code. You will be presented with data regarding the following:

1. All languages supported in your source code
2. The overall number of executable lines of code (LOC)
3. The total number of physical lines of code
4. The total number of commented lines of code
5. By file, the number of executable lines of code and the number of complex lines of the code where it can be determined.

#### Application Technical Debt Report Details

The Application Technical Debt Report provides you with an overall SAIC technical debt score as well as specific details regarding issues within your source code. You will be presented with the following information:

1. A calculated total technical debt as well as the technical debt broken down by maintainability issues, reliability issues and security issues
2. A calculated technical debt rating from 1.0 - 5.0 where 1.0 means very low technical debt and 5.0 means very high technical debt
3. A detailed breakdown by issue type (maintainability, reliability, security) including the following
   - File name
   - Suggested code change
   - Line number
   - Severity (Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor)

#### Application Cloud Readiness Report Details

The Application Cloud Readiness report is generated by the CAST Highlight tool and presents you with metrics and analysis. Each of these metrics convey specific measurable dimension of code quality and cloud readiness.

1. Normalized Cloud Readiness Index - Higher scores indicate an application is better suited for cloud migration with fewer modifications.
2. The number of security vulnerabilities
3. Cloud Blocker Score - Lower scores indicate fewer blockers to cloud migration
4. Software Resiliency index represents the presence of good or bad programming habits within your source code that make it more or less robust and secure. The higher the index the lower the likehood of defects in production.
5. Software Agility index represents the ease of maintaining your application source code. The higher the index the easier the code is to understand and maintain.
6. Software Elegance index represents code complexity. The higher the index the fewer potential defects that may arise from your code.
7. Obsolescence information informs you of the number of frameworks that are obsolete and need remediation.
8. CAST Technical Debt refers to the cost to fix the structural quality of the application per CAST Highlight calculations.

#### Application Cost Estimate Report Details

The Application Cost Estimate report utilizes data from the Cloud Readiness Report and feeds it into a tailored COCOMO Model and provides the following pieces of information.

1. The Percent Design Modified value is simply a percentage of the application design that must be modified to adapt to the new objectives or environment.
2. The Percent Code Modified value is simply a percentage of the application code that must be modified to adapt to the new objectives or environment.
3. The Software Understand value is a penalty based on the ease of understanding the code, with lower values representing better structured and descriptive code.
4. The Required Software Reliability refers to the effect caused if there is a software failure.
5. The Product Complexity value refers to specific areas of operations for your software that may effect the effort to migrate your application.
6. The Estimated Effort is the amount of time estimated to be required for completion in units of Person-Months

In order to create your complete Sage Migration Estimate Report, you will need to run the Migration Estimation tool against your uploaded code results and completed survey. This estimate will calculate your migration effort and cost as well as your compute & storage cost. Migration estimates use the COCOMO model and AI/ML with AWS SageMaker to calculate your results.

Perform the following steps to create your migration estimates.

**1. Select the Migration Estimate Icon on the App Analyzer home screen.**

![Migration Estimate](../static/img/ClickMigrationEst.png)

**2. The Migration Estimate tool will process your application immediately and show you the estimated time and refactoring cost to migrate your application to the cloud.**

![Migration Estimate](/img/MigrationEstimate.png)

Once you have run the Migration Estimates, you can also use the Interactive Calculator if you would like to see what effect different inputs would have on your estimate.

**3. If you are interested in using custom values for your COCOMO model parameters, select the Interactive Calculator icon on the Migration Estimate screen**

![Interactive Calculator Icon](/img/InteractiveCalculatorIcon.png)

The Interactive Calculator screen will come up populated with the current values used as parameters in your estimate.

![Interactive Calculator](/img/InteractiveCalculator.png)

**4. Make the changes you desire to the Derived COCOMO Parameters fields and select Preview Estimate to validate you have your desired results.**

![Interactive Calculator Edit](/img/InteractiveCalculatorEdit.png)

Your new estimated effort will be calculated based on the data you changed in the Interactive Calculator.

**5. If you are satisfied with your estimate and would like to save the changes you made in the Interactive Calculator, then select the Save Estimate Button at the bottom of the screen.**

![Interactive Calculator Save](/img/InteractiveCalculatorSaveEst.png)

**6. Once all your changes have been made and saved in the Interactive Calculator, select the X at the top of the page to exit and return to the Migration Estimate screen.**

Your complete Sage Results report will open on the Summary tab. Note there are three tabs on the Sage Results report - Summary, App Analysis Details, and Refactoring Details.

![Sage Results](/img/SageResultsTabs.png)

The Summary Tab provides you the overall estimation amounts for App Analysis and Refactoring as well as general profile information.

Selecting the App Analysis Details tab will provide you with all the information that goes into creating your App Analysis Estimation. Generally speaking, the lower an Overall Score in a category, the lower your estimated time and cost will be.

You can use your own instance of Metabase to investigate and create your own dashboards. We have provided you read only access to allow you to pull data from our Sage database. You can use the [Sage Data Dictionary](sage-data-dictionary.mdx) to determine what data is available to you. Below are the basic steps you can take to create your own analytics.

**1. From the Metabase admin menu, add a database.**

![Add Database](/img/MetabaseAddDatabase.png)

**2. Create a dashboard and name it.**

![Create Dashboard](/img/MetabaseAddDashBoard.png)

![New Dashboard](/img/MetabaseNewDashboard.png)

This will give you an empty dashboard.

![Empty Board](/img/MetabaseEmptyDashboard.png)

**3. Now it's time to get your question answered and added to your dashboard. Select "Ask a question".**

![Ask](/img/MetabaseAskQuestion.png)

**4. Select the type of question you want to ask. In this case we will select complex..**

![Custom](/img/MetabaseCustomQuestion.png)

**5. Select all the tables, columns, filters, and sort options you would like as part of your question. In this example we are asking question 1 above.**

![Question](/img/MetabaseSelectData.png)

**6. Select Visualize at the bottom of the screen and you will be presented with the data for your question.**

![Data](/img/MetabaseAnswerData.png)

**7. Select Visualization at the bottom of this screen. You will now be able to select the type of visualization you would like to see. In this case we will select Scatter and set the Scatter options.**

![Scatter](/img/MetabaseScatterBasic.png)

You can see that if you hover over the bubble in the top left of the screen, that App0031 has the highest cloud readiness index and the lowest technical debt rating, making it an easy win for moving to the cloud.

**8. If you are happy with your display you can select Done in the Settings panel and then select Save to save your question.**

![Save](/img/MetabaseQuestionSave.png)

You can, of course, try differing ways to display your data or enter varying constraints and options on the data you would like to view.

**9. Once you save your question you can choose to add it to a dashboard or simply save it for later.**

:::note

You can also create questions using Native Queries if you are knowledgeable in SQL. For example, if you wanted to answer question 7 above, you would enter the following native SQL statement into the Metabase new question (Native Query) window and then select how you want to view your data.

```
SELECT
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_cast_app_name as "Application Name",
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_cast_highlight_cloud_blocker_index as "Blocker"
FROM
    app_org INNER JOIN app_cast_highlight_tech_properties ON app_org.app_global_id = app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_global_id
where
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.end_date isnull

GROUP BY
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_global_id,
    "Application Name",
    "Blocker",

order by
    app_cast_highlight_tech_properties.app_cast_highlight_cloud_blocker_index desc;

```
