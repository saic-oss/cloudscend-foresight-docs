# CloudScend Foresight Cloud App Modernization

SAIC is transforming how government enterprises rapidly migrate their applications to the cloud at scale and low risk. Conceived from our automated Migration Factory that supports one of the largest cloud migration efforts underway in the federal government, CloudScend Foresight automates the “Rationalize & Plan” and “Analyze” processes for your entire portfolio. It gives you measurable insights into your app quality and readiness, putting you ahead of risks and toward safely migrating and optimizing your apps to use cloud resources.

## All Automated

CloudScend Foresight allows you to rationalize applications to develop a portfolio-level migration strategy and roadmap and produce a migration estimate for budgetary planning…

CloudScend Foresight can process 150,000 lines of source code in less than 5 minutes to generate the metrics and continuously assess the metrics such as cloud readiness, migration roadblocks, complexity, technical debt and security vulnerabilities…

…All automated!

## Moving the Mission Forward

Your enterprise can’t afford to expend time, staff, and resources on an ineffective or even unsuccessful application migration. And your mission-critical apps need today’s secure cloud capabilities.

CloudScend Foresight can be used to solve some of these issues using cloud migration best practices which are implemented as user-friendly features through a Secure Self-Service Portal.
