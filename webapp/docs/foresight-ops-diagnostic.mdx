### General Error Processing

When you receive an error or if a page doesn't render completely, you should follow these steps:

**1. First, simply retry the activity a second time or in the case of a page not rendering, try refreshing the page. Occasionally you may have moments of communications failures with the database or other CloudScend Foresight containers.**

**2. If after making a second attempt, you still receive the error, you should try logging out of CloudScend Foresight and then log back in and try again.**

**3. If you are still unsuccessful at performing your desired task, it's time to check the logs.**

## Error Log Location

As an administrator there may be times when you need to examine the logs for possible assistance with an error. To view the logs, follow these steps:

**1. Log on to CloudScend Foresight and perform the step that is failing.**

**2. After the error has happened, select the Log Analysis Link located under the Admin drop down on the main menu bar.**
