# Diagnostic Procedures

## Description of Error Processing

Occasionally you may experience an error when performing an action in CloudScend Foresight. When an error is received, it will likely be shown in a red box in the upper right corner of your browser for a few seconds as shown here:

### General Error Processing

When you receive an error or if a page doesn't render completely, you should follow these steps:

**1. First, simply retry the activity a second time or in the case of a page not rendering, try refreshing the page. Occasionally you may have moments of communications failures with the database or other CloudScend Foresight containers.**

**2. If after making a second attempt, you still receive the error, you should try logging out of CloudScend Foresight and then log back in and try again.**

**3. If you are still unsuccessful at performing your desired task, it's time to check the logs.**
